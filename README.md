So my middle child came home yesterday with a project, to make Excel Pixel Art for an assignment in his gifted class.
I didn't know what Excel Pixel Art was until then and he showed me what he did. He spent most of the day manually coloring cells in Excel to make a representation of Starry Night.

While his representation wasn't perfect it was pretty damn incredible that he did it by hand. I decided to have some fun with him and told him I could make ANY picture into XL Pixel Art in 20 minutes

He bet me I couldn't so I wrote a quick .NET Program that turns any picture into XL pixel art. Another "fun" aspect is that while I did write it in 20 minutes and it worked I had transposed the X and Y axis of the photo in the code so the image was coming up inverted, he was a good sport and still let me get the win after all it was only 20 minutes of code.

This morning I came back and after staring at the code for a while trying to figure out my inverted image issue @Banderson  suggested we ask Chat GPT for help.

It immediately figured out and fixed the issue (in my mind X and Y columns / rows was inverted for some reason) anyways it now works with the Right Side up Images and it is just plum fun!
I also made it so you can load ANY image and convert it ðŸ˜‰



And of-course Starry Night as Pixel Art
